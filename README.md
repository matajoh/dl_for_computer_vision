# Deep Learning for Computer Vision
This repository is a companion to a pair of lectures given at the University of Cambridge, which can be viewed here:

[1: Multi-layer Perceptrons](https://youtu.be/LDcBRixd0jQ)
[2: Convolutional Neural Nets](https://youtu.be/HfX_IOn5wjA)

The lectures were part of [Engineering Tripos Part IIB, 4F12: Computer Vision](http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/engineering-tripos-part-iib-4f12-computer-vision-2023-24).

In this repository you will find the code to reproduce most of the visualizations and experiments shared in the lectures, as well as two Jupyter Notebooks providing interactive lecture notes covering a variety of topics:

1. Perceptrons
2. Classification
3. Backpropagation
4. Gradient Descent
5. Optimisation
6. Datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, COCO)
7. Convolution
8. ResNet

## Getting Started

You should be able to run all the scripts and the notebooks by running these commands:

    pip install wheel
    pip install -r requirements.txt

And then following the [instructions to install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). You can run the scripts on their own, but they are largely meant to be run as part of one of the two Jupyter notebooks. [Learn more about Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).
